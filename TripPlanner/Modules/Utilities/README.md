# Utilities

**Utilities** is a library which represents the smallest independent piece of ecosystem. No dependency is allowed, either internal or external. The library contains utilities, extensions and functions which are helpers for building more flexible and readable code. No project specified constants are allowed here (this part have to be in Core module)
